# PFRPG Formatted Spells
I got tired of the spells on the actions tab not being formatted text (since it doesn't just strip the formatting, but actually messes it up). So, this extension makes it formatted (like the 5e ruleset).

# Compatibility and Instructions
This extension has been tested with FantasyGrounds Classic 3.3.10 and FantasyGrounds Unity 4.0.0 (2020-07-07)

Due to the files is has to edit, there is a potential for compatibility issues with other extensions. If you encounter any issues, please disable all other extensions and see if it still occurs. Either way, please let me know what you find.

# Features
* Spells on the actions tab will display with formatting when opened by clicking the link button.
