# PFRPG Formatted Spells
I got tired of the spells on the actions tab not being formatted text (since it doesn't just strip the formatting, but actually messes it up). So, this extension makes it formatted (like the 5e ruleset).

# Compatibility and Instructions
This extension has been fully tested with FantasyGrounds Classic 3.3.10 and FantasyGrounds Unity 4.0.0 (2020-07-07)

# Features
* Spells on the actions tab will display with formatting when opened by clicking the link button.
